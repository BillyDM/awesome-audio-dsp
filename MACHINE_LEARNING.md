# Machine Learning
Machine learning has been gaining traction in the audio industry lately. I don't know much about the topic myself, but I'll link some potentially useful resources here if you're interested.

- [`3Blue1Brown - Neural Networks`] - An excellent short series of YouTube videos explaining the basics of how machine learning actually works.
- [`SmartCore`] - An advanced and comprehensive machine learning library written in the [`Rust`] programming language.
