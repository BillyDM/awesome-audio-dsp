# Machine Learning
Machine learning has been gaining traction in the audio industry lately. I don't know much about the topic myself, but I'll link some potentially useful resources here if you're interested.

- [`3Blue1Brown - Neural Networks`] - An excellent short series of YouTube videos explaining the basics of how machine learning actually works.
- [`RTNeural`] - A fast neural inferencing libray in C++ made specifically for audio plugins. Used by the [`Chowdhury DSP`] suite of plugins.
- [`audioFlux`] -  A deep learning tool library for audio and music analysis.
- [`SmartCore`] - An advanced and comprehensive machine learning library written in the [`Rust`] programming language.

## Open Source Projects
Some open source projects that make use of machine learning for audio.

- [`Chowdhury DSP`] - A suite of open source audio plugins. Many of them make use of machine learning.
- [`Ultimate Vocal Remover`] - A state-of-the-art program that uses machine learning to separate vocals from a mix.
- [`NeuralNote`] - A state-of-the-art plugin that uses machine learning to convert audio to MIDI.
