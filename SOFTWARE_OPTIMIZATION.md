# Software Optimization
Tips and tools for optimizing audio software.

- [`Fast-DSP-Approximations`] - My own list of public-domain fast approximations of various expensive calculations.
- [`Intel Intrinsics Guide`] - x86 processor instrinsics
- [`Compiler Explorer`] - Very useful tool that lets you analyze the assembly output of many different languages including Rust, C, and C++.
- [`Software Optimization Resources`] - A popular resource on optimizing for x86 based architectures.
- [`Agner Fog's Instruction Tables`] - A useful table that lists the latency and throughput performance of various x86 instructions.
- [`Real-time audio programming 101`] - Tips on writing real-time code.
- [`Auto-Vectorization in LLVM`] - Tips and tricks on how to structure your code to most effectively take advantage of auto-vectorization.
- [`The Rust Performance Book`] - Tips on optimizing code in Rust.
- [`How-to Optimize Rust Programs on Linux`] - How-to guide on profiling Rust code on Linux.
