# Algorithms & Technical Papers
A list of useful articles, blogs, and scientific papers on modern algorithms and techniques for audio DSP.

- [`Cytomic Technical Papers`] - Excellent real-world useable filters and explanations by Cytomic. Use these as a better alternative to Biquad filters that behave much better while being modulated.
- [`DAFx`] - An archive of scientific papers and presentations given during an annual DSP research conference.
- [`deip.pdf`] - High quality resampling and oversampling.
- [`Signalsmith Audio Blog`] - An amazing and very useful collection of articles by Signalsmith Audio. The [`Let's Write A Reverb`] article is particularly excellent.
- [`Valhalla Blog`] - Valhalla DSP has an excellent blog linking many resources that helped them create their industry-leading reverbs.
- [`Freeverb`] - An open-source reverb algorithm.
- [`katjaas`] - Neat visual explanations of DSP mathematics and techniques.
- [`Jatin Chowdhury`] - An active blog that explores cutting-edge DSP techniques.
- [`Musicdsp.org`] - A collection of open source DSP algorithms by the community.
- [`The Design of the Roland Juno oscillators`] - A beautiful and simple explanation on the oscillators of this classic synth.
- [`TimeStretch PDF`] - A PDF explaining the DSP of [`TimeStretch`], a refinement of the famous [`PaulStretch`] time stretching effect.
