# Sound Design & Music Production
While this is not *strictly* development related, knowing how plugins are actually used to make and edit sound can give valuable insight.

- [`Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio`] - A great beginner resource on mixing fundamentals.
- [`SeamlessR`] - This guy is a fantastic teacher and really knows his stuff.
- [`How to Hear Compression`] - A brilliant video that teaches how to "hear" compressors from an artistic point of view, rather than a technical one.
- [`Au5`] - A beast legend. Need I say more?
- [`Virtual Riot`] - Another beast legend.
- [`Zircon`] - An underrated artist, and I'm personally a huge fan of his more organic, jazzy breakbeat style. Great if you're tired of loud and obnoxious "dubstep" sound design and production.
- [`Nosia`] - He and another cutting edge sound designer have a tutorial series on their Patreon.
- [`Mr. Bill`] - This guy has a lot of good tutorials on his channel.
- [`Nigel Good`] - This guy makes sounds that are *so* clean.
- [`Frequent`] - Good sound design & arrangment tutorials.
- [`Crow`] - Good tutorials on sound design and mixing.
