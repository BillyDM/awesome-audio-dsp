# DSP Playgrounds
A list of software tools that are useful for quickly and easily prototyping DSP. These can be a great start for learning and experimenting with DSP for those with little or no programming experience.

## Codeless
- [Reaktor 6] by Native Instruments
  - A popular modular environment for creating DSP without code.
  - Has a sizeable community.
  - Full version is expensive at $200 USD at the time of this writing. Free version is limited in functionality.
  - Mac and Windows only. Although some have had success running it in Linux using Wine.
- [Alpha Forever]
  - A Reaktor-like environment for creating DSP without code.
  - Commercial software that is $80 USD at the time of this writing. Although the free demo lets you use all the features, just without the ability to save.
  - Windows only.
- [The Grid] by Bitwig Studio
  - A built-in Reaktor-like plugin environment tightly integrated with the highly modular Bitwig Studio DAW.
  - Highly intuitive to use.
  - Requires Bitwig Studio, which is a whopping $400 USD at the time of this writing. However, the demo version lets you use all the features, just without the ability to save.
  - Sound quality is not the greatest.
  - Runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows.
- [VCV Rack]
  - A fully modular software environment that simulates the analogue Eurorack environment.
  - Popular with a sizeable community.
  - Arguably more "plugin"-like than actual DSP, but concepts still translate to DSP skills.
  - Free and open source.
  - Runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

## Easy Code
- [CSound]
  - A custom scripting language that is easy to learn and use.
  - Well-known and long standing in the industry.
  - Free and open-source.
- [Cmajor]
  - A JIT (just in time) compiled language specifically designed for DSP. It aims to have performance similar to C/C++.
  - Easier to learn than C/C++. However it is very similar to C, so it can be a bit harder for those who are beginners to coding.
  - Relatively new and experimental project.
  - Free and open-source.
- [py-modular]
  - A modular and experimental programming environment with basic DSP routines.
  - Uses the very popular [Python] programming language, which is a great those who are learning to code.
  - Relatively new and experimental project.
  - Free and open-source.
- [FunDSP]
  - A neat project for learning and prototyping DSP.
  - Uses the [Rust] programming language, so it is not for those who are beginners to coding. However, the library itself does not require advance Rust skills.
  - Relatively new and experimental project.
  - Free and open-source.
- [Maximilian.js]
  - Javascript bindings to the Maximilian DSP library.
  - Javascript can be great for those who are just learning to code, and it can be ran inside a web browser.
  - Free and open source.
