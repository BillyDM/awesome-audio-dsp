### *"If I'm a total noob, where should I start?"*

- [Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins in C++](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Software-Synthesizer-Plug-Ins-Audio/dp/0367510480) and [Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Audio-Effect-Plugins-C/dp/1138591939) by Will Pirkle
    - These textbooks are a common recommendation for beginners.
    - The synthesizer one is better than the effect one imo, so go for that if you plan on only buying one.
    - ISBN-10: 0367510480 and 1138591939, ISBN-13: 978-0367510480 and 978-1138591936
- [projet μ](https://mu.krj.st/) by Yü Fang
  - A great free online course that teaches the basics of DSP from scratch using the C programming language.
  - Does a great job of explaining concepts in code, along with helpful graphics.
  - Requires some knowledge of complex numbers and basic integral calculus. (There's really no any way around this if you're learning DSP). It is also very Linux-focused, but the course can still be done using Windows or MacOS.
- [Think DSP](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkDSP) - A great free online book that teaches many fundamental DSP concepts using Python.
