### *"If I'm a total noob, where should I start?"*
- [projet Î¼](https://mu.krj.st/) - An excellent and free online blog that neatly explains the basics of DSP.
- [Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins in C++](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Software-Synthesizer-Plug-Ins-Audio/dp/0367510480) and [Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Audio-Effect-Plugins-C/dp/1138591939) by Will Pirkle
    - These textbooks are a common recommendation for beginners.
    - The synthesizer one is better than the effect one imo, so go for that if you plan on only buying one.
    - ISBN-10: 0367510480 and 1138591939, ISBN-13: 978-0367510480 and 978-1138591936
- [Think DSP](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkDSP) - A great free online book that teaches many fundamental DSP concepts using Python.
