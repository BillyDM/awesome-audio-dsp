### *"If I'm a total noob, where should I start?"*
- [projet μ]: An excellent and free online blog that neatly explains the basics of DSP.
- [Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins in C++] and [Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++] by Will Pirkle
    - These textbooks are a common recommendation for beginners.
    - The synthesizer one is better than the effect one imo, so go for that if you plan on only buying one.
    - ISBN-10: 0367510480 and 1138591939, ISBN-13: 978-0367510480 and 978-1138591936
- [Think DSP]: A great free online book that teaches many fundamental DSP concepts using Python.
