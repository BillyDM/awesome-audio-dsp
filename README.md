# Awesome Audio DSP
My curated list of audio DSP (digital signal processing) and plugin development resources. New resources may be added in the future. Feel free to open a PR if you wish!

- [`Free Online Textbooks & Courses`] - A list of free online textbooks and courses on audio DSP.
- [`Paid Textbooks`] - A list of non-free textbooks on audio DSP.
- [`DSP Playgrounds`] - Software tools that are useful for quickly and easily prototyping DSP.
- [`Mathematics`] - Learning resources and tools for the mathematics of audio DSP.

### *"If I'm a total noob, where should I start?"*
- [`project μ`]: An excellent and free online blog that neatly explains the basics of DSP.
- [`Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins in C++`] and [`Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++`] by Will Pirkle
    - These textbooks are a common recommendation for beginners.
