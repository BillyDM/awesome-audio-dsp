## 1. Don't assume that a change made your code faster, measure it!

This first point is probably the most important one. All the next points are just guidelines, they aren't hard and set rules. (Except for maybe point 2, you should always avoid invoking the OS in the realtime thread.)

Perhaps you find that block-based processing performs worse for your algorithm, or maybe you find that forcing a function to be inlined performs worse, or maybe you find that SIMD intrinsics perform worse than their scalar counterparts, or maybe you find that using SIMD intrinsics to calculate filter coefficients performs better than using a lookup table, or maybe you find that the trig functions built into the standard library perform better than a "fast approximation" you found online.

Point is, it's important to learn how to measure the performance of your code. You can use both benchmarking tools and profiling tools.

If performance is a key feature of your product, treat it like one. Set up tests and actions on your GitHub repo (or whatever continuous integration system you use) to catch whenever a future change to your code or a future update to a compiler causes worse performance.

## 2. Avoid using any operations that invoke the operating system in the realtime thread

> The "realtime thread" is the thread where you plugin or application actually processes the audio buffers. This thread is also commonly referred to as the "audio thread" or the "process thread".

OS operations don't have a predictable amount of execution time, meaning the OS can delay the operation for as long as it wants, leading to latency problems and xruns. In other words, these operations are not "realtime safe". These operations include:

- Mutexes, locks, and try-locks
  - Instead, use lock-free methods for sharing data between threads. There are three commonly used methods:
    - Atomics - A single float/integer parameter value can be stored inside of an atomic value. For more information, see these articles: [(C++)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-11-atomic-header/), [(Rust)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/).
    - A lock-free single-producer single-consumer (spsc) ring buffer - Some recommendations are [SPSCQueue](https://github.com/rigtorp/SPSCQueue) in C++, and [rtrb](https://github.com/mgeier/rtrb) or [ringbuf](https://crates.io/crates/ringbuf) in Rust. In Rust there is also the [atomic_float](https://crates.io/crates/atomic_float) crate which adds floating-point atomic types.
    - A lock-free triple buffer - This is useful if you want to stream audio data between threads in a way that is tolerant to lag spikes and underruns. Some recommendations are [trio](https://github.com/brilliantsugar/trio) in C++ and [triple_buffer](https://crates.io/crates/triple_buffer) in Rust.
- Allocating and deallocating memory on the heap (i.e. `malloc` and `free` in C)
  - This also means avoid using data structures that use these operations under-the-hood such as `std::vector` in C++ and `std::Vec` in Rust. If you can, prefer to use constant-sized buffers that are allocated on the stack (i.e. arrays in C++ and Rust).
  - It is also common practice to pre-allocate all heap-allocated data at plugin initialization with a sufficient enough capacity to where it won't cause any allocations during processing. Most plugin APIs send a "maximum block frames" argument to the plugin's intiliazer to let it know the maximum number of frames it should allocate for.
  - You can also allocate buffers on the GUI/main thread and then send a pointer to that buffer to the realtime thread (i.e. buffers containing audio samples for a sampler plugin). Just make sure that when the audio thread is done using the buffer that it sends it back to the GUI/main thread to be deallocated.
- Reading/writing a file
  - If you need to stream data (for example a plugin that records to a file), then run that stream in a separate thread and pass data to/from the realtime thread via a realtime-safe ring buffer.
- Printing to the terminal
  - While this is fine to do while developing and debugging a plugin, just make sure that you disable terminal printing operations in the realtime thread before shipping the plugin or when measuring its performance.

## 3. Beware of denormals

Denormals are a quirk of how floating point numbers work inside a CPU. It is not rare for DSP code to generate denormal numbers, and when it happens it can lead to substantial slowdowns on certain CPU architectures like x86 (Most ARM-based CPUs don't suffer from this problem, but you still might want to disable them to have parity with your x86 code).

The article [projet Î¼ - denormal](https://mu.krj.st/denormal/) does a much better job at explaining this topic than I ever could. It also explains various techniques for avoiding denormals.

If you are using Rust, there is a handy crate called [no_denormals](https://crates.io/crates/no_denormals) which simplifies the technique as described in the section "2.4.1 Flushing denormals" in that article.

## 4. Avoid excessive division and modulo operations

The division and modulo operations on both floating point and integer numbers are significantly more expensive than the addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations. If the same divisor is being used over and over again (it's especially common to divide by the sample rate), consider taking the reciprocal of the divisor once and then multiplying by the reciprocal.

Sometimes compilers automatically apply the "multiplication by the reciprocal" optimization, but sometimes they don't. If you want to rely on this, use tools like [Compiler Explorer]* to verify the assembly.

## 5. Prefer to use block-based processing instead of per-sample processing

In other words, prefer to use processing loops that process a chunk (aka block) of samples in each loop iteration instead of loops that process just a single sample in each loop iteration.

The optimal block size will usually be somewhere around 8 to 1024 samples. The key is to find the right balance between reducing the overhead of function calling and branching logic, and avoiding cache misses (which I will explain in points 6, 7, and 8). Experiment to see what performs best for your code.

There are a few different way to go about using block-based processing:

- The simplest way is to wait until a block is fully filled with samples before processing them. This can make your algorithm easier since you always know exactly how many samples are in each block. The downside to this approach is that it adds latency to the plugin (the latency introduced by the plugin will be equal to the block size, so try to use the smallest block size possible if you use this approach). 
- Another way is to make your algorithm work with a dynamic number of samples per loop iteration (even with a block size of 1 sample). But this can be considerably more complicated to set up. The advantage is that you won't add extra latency.
- Another way is to create different processing loops depending on how many samples are sent from the host (including a case where the host only sends 1 sample, yes it does happen). The downside of course is duplicated code.

Also keep in mind that because block-based processing is considerably more complicated to set up than per-sample processing, it's okay to use per-sample processing while you are still in the stages of developing and experimenting with your actual DSP algorithms.

## 6. Cache misses are expensive on modern CPUs

Modern CPUs rely heavily on cached memory for their performance. If an operation causes the CPU to fetch data that is not readily available in its low-level cache, it has to wait around to pull that data from either high-level cache or from RAM.

One way to avoid cache misses is to make sure your buffers aren't too large, so that the CPU can fit all of the working buffers into its low-level cache. The optimal buffer (block) size will usually be somewhere around 8 to 2048 samples depending on how many buffers you have. Experiment to see what performs best for your code.

## 7. Avoid excessive calls to medium/large-sized functions

Calling a function has a small amount of overhead, and this overhead can add up if called thousands or millions of times a second. Large function calls also makes it harder for a CPU to optimally cache its working memory.

By using block-based processing, you can reduce the number of function calls by only calling the function once per block of samples instead of calling them once per sample.

And note that I said "medium/large-sized functions". Modern compilers are really good at inlining small functions. But if you're still unsure whether or not a function is being inlined properly by the compiler, you can use tools like [Compiler Explorer]* to verify the assembly. If it's not being inlined properly, you can use the `__forceinline` or `inline __attribute__((always_inline))` keywords in C++ or the `#[inline(always)]` keyword in Rust to try to force the compiler to inline it. Even then, always measure the performance to see if inlining the function actually improves performance, because a lot of times it can actually make the performance worse (it also can make the size of the compiled binary much larger).

## 8. Avoid excessive if and switch statements

Branching logic has a small amount of overhead, and this overhead can add up if called thousands or millions of times a second. Branching logic also makes it harder for a CPU to optimally cache its working memory.

This includes hidden if statements such as `asserts` or bounds-checking the index into an array.

By using block-based processing, you can reduce the number of branches by only invoking them once per block of samples instead of invoking them once per sample.

You can also try having multiple loops, one for each case. But of course the downside to that approach is duplicated code.

Also note that sometimes compilers can optimize branching inside loops by automatically splitting it into multiple loops. But if you rely on this, use tools like [Compiler Explorer]* to verify the assembly.

Even then, modern CPUs tend to make heavy use of speculative execution to mitigate the overhead from branching. Always measure the performance to see if optimizing the branching logic actually makes a meaningful improvement. You can also try using compiler hints to improve speculative execution with the `[[likely]]`/`[[unlikely]]` attributes in C++ or the `std::intrinsics::likely`/`std::intrinsics::unlikely` intrinsics in Rust (there is also the [likely_stable](https://crates.io/crates/likely_stable) crate for the stable Rust compiler).

## 9. Try caching expensive calculations into lookup tables

A common way to speed up expensive calculations is to precompute the calculation for a large range of inputs, and then storing the results into a lookup table. This is especially common practice for filter coefficients.

However, keep in mind that if the lookup table is too large, then it can cause cache misses in the CPU. Experiment to find the optimal lookup table size for your algorithm.

## 10. Try using SIMD intrinsics

SIMD intrinsics are special features built into CPUs that allow it to pack multiple numbers into a single "vector" object (not to be confused with `std::vector` in C++ or `std::Vec` in Rust) and then apply an operation to every number in that vector at the same time. It's kind of like multithreaded processing, but in a super fast single-threaded kind of way.

One big downside to using SIMD intrinsics is that these methods can differ between CPU architectures such as x86 and ARM, and they can even differ between different vendors and generations of CPUs. So this can create a lot of platform-specific code. If you don't want to mess with platform-specific code, there are some libraries that attempt to abstract over these intrinsics in a portable, cross-platform way including [highway](https://github.com/google/highway), [eve](https://github.com/jfalcou/eve), [MIPP](https://github.com/aff3ct/MIPP), and [libsimdcpp](https://github.com/p12tic/libsimdpp) in C++ and [portable-simd](https://github.com/rust-lang/portable-simd) in Rust (currently requires nightly Rust).

For a list of SIMD intrinsics in x86 processors, look at the [Intel Intrinsics Guide](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide).

Also note that modern compilers have a feature called "autovectorization" where they can automatically create SIMD code for the given target CPU. However, this process can be unreliable for all but the simplest algorithms. But if you want to rely on this, you can use [Compiler Explorer]* to verify the assembly, and you can follow [Auto-Vectorization in LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/Vectorizers.html) for some tips.

Also keep in mind that because SIMD intrinsics are considerably more complicated, it's fine to not use them while you are still in the stages of developing and experimenting with your actual DSP algorithms. Keeping a scalar version of your code around is also a smart idea for readability and to keep your code more future-proof, even if you end up commenting it out.

## 11. Prefer to use single-precision floats instead of double-precision floats

Using single-precision floats have two main performance advantages:

- The biggest advantage is that single-precision uses half the memory, so the CPU can fit more samples into its low-level cache and reduce the occurrence of cache misses. This can especially be important for large lookup tables.
- Twice as many single-precision floats can be packed into an SIMD vector, theoretically doubling the performance of algorithms that make heavy use of SIMD intrinsics.

While there is some debate on whether using double-precision actually makes a difference to sound quality (and there are specific algorithms that do require the extra precision), the general consensus is that the noise introduced from single-precision quantization errors is negligible, and other factors such as the quality of filter models and antialiasing algorithms have a far greater impact on sound quality. Still, if you find that using double-precision doesn't meaningfully impact performance in your algorithm, then there's no harm in using double-precision if you want to.

You should also avoid the common direct-form biquad filter model since it performs quite poorly with single-precision floats. Prefer to use SVF filter models instead since they are better than biquad filters in practically every way (especially in terms of sound quality when using single-precision floats). The [Cytomic Technical Papers](https://cytomic.com/technical-papers/) explain them in detail, and specifically the [SvfLinearTrapOptimised2](https://cytomic.com/files/dsp/SvfLinearTrapOptimised2.pdf) document has drop-in replacements for biquad filters.

> Single-precision floats are more susceptible to [denormals], so be aware of the various solutions to fix this problem.

## 12. Compiler Flags

Sometimes optimizations can be as simple as enabling a flag in your compiler.

In addition to the obvious of using a "release" profile instead of a "debug" profile, there are additional features that may improve performance (and also binary size).

The most straightforward feature is link time optimizations (LTO). This tells the compiler to make additional optimizations while linking together different modules/dependencies. This also can help reduce the binary size by removing unneeded dead code. The drawback is that it can greatly increase the compile times, which is why it's usually not enabled by default. Some compilers also have a "thin" LTO option which can give similar performance gains while not adding as much compile time.

Another thing to consider is enabling optimizations for specific CPU features like [AVX2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#Advanced_Vector_Extensions_2) or [Arm Neon](https://www.arm.com/technologies/neon). The downside is that the resulting binary can only be run on systems that have a CPU with those features, which limits your userbase. 

There are however a couple ways around this:

* The first is to supply multiple binaries and have the user install the one that matches their system (or better is to create an automated installer that does this).
* The second is to detect these CPU features at runtime and then run different functions based on that (a process called "CPU dispatching" or "multiversioning").
    * Here are a couple of useful articles on multiversioning, [one for C/C++](https://johnnysswlab.com/cpu-dispatching-make-your-code-both-portable-and-fast/) and [one for Rust](https://alexheretic.github.io/posts/auto-avx2/).
