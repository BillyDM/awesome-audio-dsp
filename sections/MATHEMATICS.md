# Mathematics

Learning resources and tools for the mathematics of audio DSP.

DSP (Digital Signal Processing) is the study of using a digital computer to process what is normally thought of as an analog signal (such as sound). Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on who you are ðŸ˜‰), the reality is that DSP is a math heavy field. However, the math needed to get started is not *too* difficult in my opinion. Knowing high-school level math and some of the basics of college-level math will get you most of the way there.

## Prerequisites

I recommend knowing at least these fundamental concepts in order to best get started with learning DSP:

- Algebra dealing with polynomials, fractions, and exponents (exponents are especially important here)
- Basic trigonometry like sine, cosine, tangent, arctangent, etc.
- Logarithms (especially the natural logarithm and the number "e")
- Complex (imaginary) numbers and complex algebra (using algebra with complex numbers). Complex numbers are a core pillar of DSP mathematics.

### Nice to haves

These prerequisites aren't strictly necessary, but they can help you understand things better.

- Basic knowledge of linear algebra (the study of transforming data with matrices).
- Basic knowledge of calculus such as derivatives and integrals.
- Basic knowledge of what differential equations are and why they are important. (Note I don't mean knowing how to actually *solve* differential equations, because they are "really freakin' hard to solve" to put it lightly.)
