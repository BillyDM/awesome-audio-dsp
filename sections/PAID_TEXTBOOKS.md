# Paid Textbooks
A list of non-free textbooks on audio DSP.

- [Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins in C++] and [Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++] by Will Pirkle
  - One of the most highly recommended resources for entering the world of audio DSP.
  - Great beginner resource that teaches fundamental DSP concepts without going into too much mathematics.
  - The synthesizer one is better than the effect one imo, so go for that if you plan on only buying one.
  - Focuses on teaching concepts, not on writing performant code. His coding style is not that efficient for real-world use.
  - ISBN-10: 0367510480 and 1138591939, ISBN-13: 978-0367510480 and 978-1138591936

- [A Digital Signal Processing Primer] by Kenneth Steiglitz
  - Great introduction to the mathematics of DSP.
  - Focuses more on mathematics and does not have many example effects.
  - ISBN-10: 0486845834, ISBN-13: 978-0486845838

- [DAFX: Digital Audio Effects] by Udo ZÃ¶lzer (Editor)
  - Explores good modern advanced effects. It's made by the [DAFx] annual scientific research conference.
  - MATLAB is used for its code examples, but [GNU Octave] could probably be used as well.
  - ISBN-10: 0470665998, ISBN-13: 978-0470665992

- [Digital Signal Processing: Concepts and Applications] by Mulgrew, Grant & Thompson
  - Covers the basic principles of DSP in an easy-to-digest way without going into too much mathematics.
  - Focuses more on general DSP rather than audio DSP.
  - Uses MATLAB for its code examples, but [GNU Octave] could probably be used as well.
  - ISBN-10: 0333963563, ISBN-13: 978-0333963562

- [Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists] by Steven Smith
  - Another book recommended to beginners.
  - Focuses more on general DSP rather than audio DSP.
  - Uses MATLAB for its code examples, but [GNU Octave] could probably be used as well.
  - ISBN-10: 075067444X, ISBN-13: 978-0750674447
