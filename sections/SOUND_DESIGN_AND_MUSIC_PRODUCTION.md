# Sound Design & Music Production

While this is not *strictly* development related, knowing how plugins are actually used to make and edit sound can give valuable insight.

> Most of the artists listed below are obviously geared more towards electronic music and my tastes, but they still might be helpful even if you aren't into that genre.

- [Au5](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCP_w7OAVom-d5SMebEPdwrkiNNGCv53N) - A beast legend. Need I say more?
- [AutoEq](https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq) - Free and open source tool for applying EQ correction to a wide variety of headphones. Note that you shouldn't use the premade results since they target the "Harman Curve". Instead, use the online tool to generate a result that uses the "Flat" target (under "Show advanced" -> "Target").
  - I also found that the  [IEF Neutral](https://github.com/iwalton3/AutoEq) target sounds really good if the flat target sounds too lackluster for you.
  - There are also paid alternatives like [Sonarworks](https://www.sonarworks.com/) or [Toneboosters Morphit](https://toneboosters.com/tb_morphit_v1.html).
- [Crow](https://www.youtube.com/c/CrowOfficial/videos) - Good tutorials on sound design and mixing.
- [Frequent](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVMbWJCB-79KbDZ51eakZgQ) - Good sound design & arrangement tutorials.
- [How to Hear Compression](https://youtu.be/K0XGXz6SHco) - A brilliant video that teaches how to "hear" compressors from an artistic point of view, rather than a technical one.
- [Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio](https://www.amazon.com/Mixing-Secrets-Small-Studio-Presents/dp/0240815807) - A great beginner resource on mixing fundamentals.
- [Mr. Bill](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDxTQYPyq4JTRvdmYDiykyOdoEjjyuQgI) - This guy has a lot of good tutorials on his channel.
- [Nigel Good](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnqL5z-OAN-QHT4aRFtpvWA) - This guy makes sounds that are *so* clean.
- [Nosia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzM37xuFFxY) - He and another cutting edge sound designers have a tutorial series on their Patreon.
- [SeamlessR](https://www.youtube.com/@SeamlessR) - This guy is a great teacher and really knows his stuff.
  - The [Production Basics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGYoE903Nir7qVmd-b333OT7Wj4EAltGT) and [How to Synth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9waiQonCGp4&list=PLGYoE903Nir5LfIWap-x8aEV6Q-YkE6c4) playlists are good places to start.
- [Virtual Riot](https://www.youtube.com/c/OfficialVirtualRiot/featured) - Another beast legend.
- [Zircon](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD8FC11AD5EB41006) - An underrated artist, and I'm personally a huge fan of his more organic, jazzy breakbeat style. Great if you're tired of loud and obnoxious "dubstep/dnb" sound design and production videos.
