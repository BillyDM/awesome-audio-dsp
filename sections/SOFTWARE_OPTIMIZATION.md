# Software Optimization

Tips and tools for optimizing audio software.

- [Agner Fog's Instruction Tables](https://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf) - A useful table that lists the latency and throughput performance of various x86 instructions.
- [Algorithms for Modern Hardware](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/) by Sergey Slotin - Free online book on high performance computing.
  - The [Profiling](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/profiling/) chapter is a good guide on how to do effective profiling and benchmarking.
- [Audio Software Optimization Tips](../content/AUDIO_SOFTWARE_OPTIMIZATION_TIPS.md) - My own list of audio software optimization tips.
- [Auto-Vectorization in LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/Vectorizers.html) - Tips and tricks on how to structure your code to most effectively take advantage of auto-vectorization.
- [Compiler Explorer] - Very useful tool that lets you analyze the assembly output of many different languages including Rust, C, and C++.
  - Note, you will generally want to enable compiler optimizations when using this tool to get the assembly output for release mode. To do this, enter the following text into the "Compiler options..." field for your given language/compiler:
    - C/C++ (gcc or clang): `-O3`
    - C/C++ (msvc): `/O2`
    - Rust: `-C opt-level=3`
  - Sometimes the compiler optimizes so much that it removes the function you want to analyze entirely (i.e. dead code elimination). To fix this, use the following function attributes for your given language/compiler:
    - C/C++ (gcc): `__attribute__((optimize("O0")))`
        - *Place this on a function that calls the function you want to analyze, not the function itself. For example:*
        - ```c
          int __attribute__((optimize("O0"))) main() {
            foo_my_function_to_analyze();
            return 0;
          }
          ```
    - C/C++ (clang): `__attribute__ ((optnone))`
        - *Place this on a function that calls the function you want to analyze, not the function itself. For example:*
        - ```c
          int __attribute__ ((optnone)) main() {
            foo_my_function_to_analyze();
            return 0;
          }
          ```
    - C/C++ (msvc): `#pragma optimize( "", off )` / `#pragma optimize( "", on )`
      - *Place these around a function that calls the function you want to analyze, not the function itself. For example:*
      - ```c
        #pragma optimize( "", off )
        int main() {
          foo_my_function_to_analyze();
          return 0;
        }
        #pragma optimize( "", on )
        ```
    - Rust: `#[no_mangle]` or `#[inline(never)]`
      - ```rust
        #[no_mangle]
        pub fn foo_my_function_to_analyze() {
          // ...
        }
        ```

  - Note, don't set `opt-level` to "s" or "z" because that will likely make performance much worse (except for maybe when running on an embedded system with little memory).
