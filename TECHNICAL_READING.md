# Technical Reading
A list of useful articles, blogs, and scientific papers on modern algorithms and techniques for audio DSP.

- [`Cytomic Technical Papers`] - Excellent filter designs, equations, and explanations by Cytomic. Use these as a better alternative to biquad filters that both sound better and perform better when being modulated. 
  - Specifically the document [`SvfLinearTrapOptimised2`](https://cytomic.com/files/dsp/SvfLinearTrapOptimised2.pdf) contains filters and equations that are a better alternative to the ones in the [`RBJ Cookbook`](https://webaudio.github.io/Audio-EQ-Cookbook/audio-eq-cookbook.html).
- [`DAFx`] - An archive of scientific papers and presentations given during an annual DSP research conference.
- [`ADC Videos`] - This YouTube channel hosts a bunch of talks and lectures given during the annual [`Audio Developer's Conference`].
  - This one on [`high quality wavetable oscillators`] by the creator of the Vital synth is particularly good one for those interested in wavetable synthesis.
- [`AES`] - A large collection of high quality research and technical papers. Requires a paid membership to access.
- [`deip.pdf`] - A collection of high quality and fast sub-sample interpolators.
- [`Signalsmith Audio Blog`] - An amazing and very useful collection of articles by Signalsmith Audio. The [`Let's Write A Reverb`] article is particularly excellent.
- [`Freeverb3 - DSP References`] - A huge list of technical DSP resources focused mainly on reverb design.
- [`Valhalla Blog`] - Valhalla DSP has an excellent blog linking many resources that helped them create their industry-leading reverbs.
- [`Freeverb`] - An open-source reverb algorithm.
- [`katjaas`] - Neat visual explanations of DSP mathematics and techniques.
- [`Jatin Chowdhury`] - An active blog that explores cutting-edge DSP techniques.
- [`Musicdsp.org`] - A collection of open source DSP algorithms by the community.
- [`The Design of the Roland Juno oscillators`] - A beautiful and simple explanation on the oscillators of this classic synth.
- [`TimeStretch PDF`] - A PDF explaining the DSP of [`TimeStretch`], a refinement of the famous [`PaulStretch`] time stretching effect.
- [`synfx-dsp`] - A Rust crate that has several useful essential DSP algorithms you can reference along with links to relevant resources, used by the [`HexoSynth`] plugin. Includes algorithms such as filters, oscillators, LFOs, sub-sample interpolation, envelopes, waveshapers, oversampling, and a reverb.
- [`Reaktor 6 DSP Articles`] - A collection of DSP articles by Native Instruments. It also includes examples of how to implement them in Reaktor 6.
