# Paid Textbooks
A list of non-free textbooks on audio DSP.

- [`Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins in C++`] and [`Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++`] by Will Pirkle
  - One of the most highly recommended resources for entering the world of audio DSP.
  - Great beginner resource that teaches fundamental DSP concepts without going into too much mathematics.
  - The synthesizer one is better than the effect one imo, so go for that if you plan on only buying one.
  - Focuses on teaching concepts, not on writing performant code. His coding sytle is quite ineffecient.

- [`A Digital Signal Processing Primer`] by Kenneth Steiglitz
  - Great introduction to the mathematics of DSP.
  - Focuses more on mathematics and does not have many example effects.

- [`DAFX: Digital Audio Effects`] by Udo ZÃ¶lzer (Editor)
  - Explores good modern advanced effects. It's made by the [`DAFx`] annual scientific research conference.
  - MATLAB is used for its code examples, but [`GNU Octave`] could probably be used as well.

- [`Digital Signal Processing: Concepts and Applications`] by Mulgrew, Grant & Thompson
  - Covers the basic principles of DSP in an easy-to-digest way without going into too much mathematics.
  - Focuses more on general DSP rather than audio DSP.
  - Uses MATLAB for its code examples, but [`GNU Octave`] could probably be used as well.

- [`Code Your Own Synth Plug-Ins With C++ and JUCE`] by Matthijs Hollemans
  - Step-by-step guide that teaches how to build a fully-featured synthesizer plug-in.
  - This book is aimed at beginners and is light on the mathematics, with in-depth explanations of the algorithms used.
  - Uses the JUCE framework and C++.
