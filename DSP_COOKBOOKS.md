# DSP Cookbooks

A list of algorithms and equations you can use and reference for your own DSP designs.

- [`Musicdsp.org`](https://www.musicdsp.org/en/latest/index.html) - A large collection of open source DSP algorithms by the community.
- [`Audio EQ Cookbook`](https://webaudio.github.io/Audio-EQ-Cookbook/audio-eq-cookbook.html) - A collection of equations for calculating biquad filter coefficients.
- [`deip.pdf`](https://github.com/BillyDM/Audio-DSP-Resources/blob/main/deip.pdf) - A collection of high quality and fast sub-sample interpolators.
- [`Cytomic Technical Papers`](https://cytomic.com/index.php?q=technical-papers) - Excellent filter designs and explanations by Cytomic. Use these as a better alternative to biquad filters.
- [`Fast-DSP-Approximations`](https://github.com/BillyDM/Fast-DSP-Approximations) - My own list of public-domain fast approximations of various expensive calculations.
