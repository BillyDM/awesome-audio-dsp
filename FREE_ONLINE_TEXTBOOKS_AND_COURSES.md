# Free Online Textbooks & Courses
A list of free online textbooks and courses on audio DSP.

- [`projet μ`] by Yü Fang
  - An incredible online guide walking you through how audio DSP works with examples of common algorithms to get you started.
  - Shows very clearly how to apply these algorithms in actual code, and also has helpful and nice looking graphs.
  - Requires knowledge of complex numbers, integral calculus, and the C programming language. (It is also very unix-focused).
  - Currently a work in progress, and more tutorials will likely be added later.

- [`Think DSP`] by Allen B. Downey
  - A great free online book for beginners that teaches many fundamental DSP concepts using Python.
  - Teaches concepts from a programming-based approach, rather than an abstract mathematical approach.
  - Requires knowledge of Python, and some knowledge of complex numbers and integral calculus.

- [`The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing`] by Steven W. Smith, Ph.D.
  - A common recommendation from many folks.
  - Focuses on DSP in general, not just audio DSP.
  - Relatively heavy on mathematics.

- [`MIT OCW: Signals and Systems`] by Prof. Dennis Freeman 
  - A free online college level course including pre-recorded video lectures, lecture notes, and assignments.
  - Here is a link to the [`video lectures on Youtube`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61kdPAOC7CzFjJZ8f1eMUxs) if you can't get the videos to play on their website.

- [`Julius Orion Smith III Collection`]
  - A great collection of books and resources by Julius Orion Smith III.
  - Very comprehensive, and covers many topics on the mathematics and applications of audio DSP. Good for getting a solid foundation.
  - Contains code examples in C and MatLab (although [`GNU Octave`] can be used as well).
  - Relatively heavy on mathematics.

- [`The Art of VA Filter Design`] by Vadim Zavalishin
  - Teaches good techniques for adapting analogue designs into the digital realm.
  - Relatively heavy on mathematics.

- [`The Theory and Technique of Electronic Music`] by Miller Puckette
  - Focuses more on musical DSP.
  - Teaches core concepts of many common audio effects and synthesizers.
  - Relatively heavy on mathematics.
